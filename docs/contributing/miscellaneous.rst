Release checklist
-----------------------------------------

GE core team members use this checklist to ship releases.

* Merge all approved PRs into ``develop``.
* Make a new branch from ``develop`` called something like ``release-prep``.
* In this branch, update the version number in the ``.travis.yml`` file (look in the deploy section). (This sed snippet is handy if you change the numbers ``sed -i '' 's/0\.9\.6/0\.9\.7/g' .travis.yml``)

* Update the ``changelog.rst``: move all things under ``develop`` under a new heading with the new release number.

  * Verify that any changes to requirements are specifically identified in the changelog
  
* Submit this as a PR against ``develop``
* After successful checks, get it approved and merged.
* Update your local branches and switch to master: ``git fetch --all; git checkout master; git pull``. 
* Merge the now-updated ``develop`` branch into ``master`` and trigger the release: ``git merge origin/develop; git push``
* Wait for all the builds to complete (including the deploy job).
* Check `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/great-expectations/#history>`__ for the new release
* Create an annotated git tag:

  * Run ``git tag -a <<VERSION>> -m "<<VERSION>>"`` with the correct new version
  * Push the tag up by running ``git push origin <<VERSION>>`` with the correct new version
  * Merge ``master`` into ``develop`` so that the tagged commit becomes part of the history for ``develop``: ``git checkout develop; git pull; git merge master``
  * On develop, add a new "develop" section header to changelog.rst, and push the updated file with message "Update changelog for develop"

* `Create the release on GitHub <https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations/releases>`__ with the version number. Copy the changelog notes into the release notes, and update any rst-specific links to use github issue numbers.
* Notify kyle@superconductive.com about any community-contributed PRs that should be celebrated.
* Socialize the release on GE slack by copying the changelog with an optional nice personal message (thank people if you can)
* Review the automatically-generated PR for conda-forge (https://github.com/conda-forge/great-expectations-feedstock/pulls), updating requirements as necessary and verifying the build status.
